# Adoption

While designing for self service is probably the most important thing you can do to encourage people to use a platform, it is not the only factor. At different stages in the adoption of a platform you may need to employ additional approaches including ensuring that early adopters become evangelists, learning to say 'no', and smart use of mandates.

## 1. Use early adopters to demonstrate capability and build trust

While the aim should be to design for self-service, there will always be a first user. You will probably find more enthusiasm for teams looking to be the second or third (once they can point to the fact someone else is using it). As such, give the 1st user 'VIP treatment', co-locating with them if necessary.

Map out how you will make your team available to support and address the concerns of the first user.

Once a platform or register has been adopted by one team in an agency, it is likely that others will adopt it too. This is partly because of trust, and partly because any contractual problems will likely have been solved. Blog and talk about it so other teams know this.

Be open about what you are learning through user research and observing usage. If you are able to, publish your roadmap in the open too.

## 2. Do 'sales'

Be open and transparent about costs to the users of your platform. Help them understand the unit costs and how those will reduce as more services use the platform. Do this even if they are not directly paying for the service (as it will help them understand the cost if that becomes nessesary in the future).

Explain how it will make the lives of public servants easier, as well as the lives of citizens. Be clear and confident about the value that you are delivering in terms of savings and usage. E.g. It's going to ‘save this much time’ or ‘it's going to be this much more valuable in terms of marginal costs’ or ‘your integration costs are going to be lower’. 

Showing a working prototype that uses platforms is worth a million slick sales presentations.

## 3. Understand the risks of high-volume users early on

There are risks and opportunities around trying to get a platform adopted by high profile services, especially early on in its development. While it might lend credibility, it can also risk the platform being tightly coupled with the demands of one use-case. They may also have demands around scale and robustness that it might be hard to satisfy early on in development.

Don't be afraid to say no to feature requests, even from big users. Especially if it is unlikely to meet a common need that other users have.

## 4. Mandate the right thing (and only once it works)

While the aim should always be to design platforms that clearly meet a the needs of users and are so good they want to use it, there is a role for mandates. They key appears to be getting the level of the mandate right. 

At Google, for example, things that are mandated are really high-level, rather than day-to-day - everything rolls-up to a higher objective.[^1] And Estonia didn't mandate X-Road, they mandated the principle of 'tell us once' (and only once X-Road had proved itself).[^2]

Be careful about mandating the use of any particular platform, and only do so once you have proved it is effective.
