# Funding and operations

Because of changing user behaviour and evolving privacy and security risks, platforms need to be developed and operated by a standing team with an understanding of the needs of their users. Those teams should be in a position to continuously improve the platform and respond to any risks. As such, it is important they are funded for the long-term, rather than treated as fixed-term projects, or quasi-commercial entities expected to pay their way.

## 1. Create standing teams to develop and operate new platforms

Bugs are a fact of life, as are malicious attacks. It’s also a side effect of a successful platform that it’s hard to know exactly how users will make use of it, meaning both user-behaviour and risks will change over time. For these reasons, a multidisciplinary team who are incentivized to improve the platform and respond to risks continuously is the preferred approach to the development of new platforms. (Even in situations where some element of the platform is outsourced, you will still need to maintain the expertise in-house to monitor and audit.)

These teams do not need to be large, but they do need to be invested in the long-term health of the platform.

Android, for example, has a small, very senior team. The lead developer for the Android platform, which powers 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, has a few dozen people on her team. The core framework team is an even smaller group of people, and many of them have been there since the beginning.[^1]

## 2. Fund teams for the long-term

Funding platforms on a fixed-term basis is at odds with the idea of shared infrastructure. (Who would build on top of a platform if they didn't know if it was going to be about in a year or two?) It also makes the retention of the team needed to operate and continuously improve platforms harvder.

Cost-recovery based funding is also not easily compatible with the development of platforms for the simple fact that the cost-per-transaction decreases as the user base increases, saddling early users with higher costs.

For governments used to modes of funding not suited to platforms, such as funding fixed-term projects or operating on a cost recovery basis, this may represent a significant change both practically and culturally. But it's important to get it right.

## 3. Understand any legal and constitutional constraints on funding models

There may be constraints on the funding models that can be used for certain types of users. For example, in the USA, federal agencies are precluded from charging states for services.[^2] At the same time, some organizations may be required by law to recover costs and therefore find it harder to offer platforms.[^3]

In the long run, such issues may not make for a very good operating model. In the short-term, it is important to understand the constraints.

##  4. Fund emergent platforms

While the need for some platforms may be more obvious, and the funding easier to secure (for example, hosting or payments meet clear needs for multiple services), some needs will be more emergent.

As previously discussed (see 'Identifying platforms'), 'point solutions' developed from within product teams, with the potential for broader use will need support and funding made available to support them.

## 5. Make charging a strategic choice, not a budgetary one

Charging for a service may be too high a bar for some users, not necessarily because of the per-use cost, but due to the administrative costs associated with procurement.

The GOV.UK Notify messaging platform, for example, realized they serve more users by offering the service free to the majority of users. They were only in a position to be able to do this because they are centrally funded. [^4]

In a limited number of cases, charging for high usage may be a way of ensuring efficient use.
