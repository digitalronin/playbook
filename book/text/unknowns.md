# Unknowns and questions

This playbook aims to provide useful, actionable advice for practitioners looking for approaches to implementing platforms in government. However, this is an emergent area and is likely to remain so for some time. As such, there are lots of things that the answers to are out of sight (or at the very least too far away to be anything other than fuzzy).

Below are a few areas that are in demand of more thought and research, along with links to further reading. They are worth having at the back of your mind as you consider developing platforms. Maybe in the next version of this playbook they might demand sections of their own, or perhaps they might turn out to be non-issues.

## What will platforms do to public understanding of government?

Today government is often bureaucratic and hard to understand. But hard to understand is different from not being understandable. As more data is used to deliver more services, and more decisions can be made automatically, what will it do to people’s mental model of government and will it be one that they trust? What will the cumulative effect of the development of a platform ecosystem be? What myths might arise about how the system works, in place of clear understanding of how it does?
 
For example, some Indians have reverted to paying their taxes via paper forms (which does not require an Aadhaar number) rather than use the online service.[^1] In the UK there have been public health concerns about data being shared between the National Health Service and the agency responsible for immigration.[^2]

Hopefully, some of the transparency and accountability measures listed in this playbook will play a part in maintaining the understandability of government, but that is far from clear.

## Where might 'legislation as code' be useful?

The idea of publishing legislation as executable code has been suggested by various people, with experiments in New Zealand and France using the OpenFisca software.[^3][^4][^5][^6] There are people exploring the idea of encoding international trade rules as code.[^7]

## What's the role of data trusts?

A data trust is a legal structure that provides independent stewardship of data (possibly including some technical constraints on reuse).[^8][^9][^10] In the UK, the Open Data Institute has been conducting some trials of data trusts, and Sidewalk Labs has proposed data trusts as a way of managing urban data (although the proposals have been criticised as "poorly defined").[^11]

## Where will there be a need for new organizations?

We are used to the idea of government being organized into vertically-integrated thematic agencies (environment, benefits, tax, driving etc). And with the idea of hierarchically and geographically organized government (local, municipal, devolved, state, provincial government etc).

Platforms represent a change to something more networked. Where will entirely new organizations be needed to operate platforms? In India, for example, the Goods and Services Tax Network operates APIs and other infrastructure needed to operate the national harmonized sales tax. GSTN is a non-profit company owned partly by the national and state level governments. [^12]

When should platforms should be directly politically accountable via a minister or secretary? When should they be placed outside of day-to-day politics?

## What's the role of data embassies?

Estonia plans to backup data and keep providing digital services in the face of a cyber attack. The solution has been to declare a rack in a data center in Luxembourg an Estonian embassy with all the protections of the Vienna Convention.[^13]
