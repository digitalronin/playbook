# Understanding who your users are

Platforms are used as components to build services. The primary users of a platform, therefore, tend not the public themselves, but rather the teams who use them to design services for the public.

As such, your team may not have any direct relationship with end-users. This does not mean you do not have users. Some user-types it is essential to consider when designing platforms include:

* **Developers** wanting to integrate with your platforms quickly and easily. They may work as part of teams in another part of the government, or outside government.
* **Designers** of a service who need to understand how your platform will fit into the broader design and include it in prototypes they are testing
* **Procurement managers** who need to know how any contractual or financial arrangements work (although hopefully, you will have minimized these)
* **Administrators** who might need to manage the use of the platform, such as viewing usage reports or changing their settings
* **Your team** who will need to understand how other users are using the platform
* **Politicians or senior officials** who might have statutory responsibility for the data you hold or the budget you spend
* **The general public** and their representatives who want to understand how you are spending - unlicensed money and managing public data
*  **Users of services** that have used your platform

### Your platform is part of many services

Your platform will be part of many public facing services. That means any changes you make will affect many different types of user and many different user-journeys. 

This comes with a responsibility to understand the likely impacts of any changes you make and to work in an open way, so your users can anticipate changes early.

### A true platform means you don’t know how it will be used

It is in the nature of a true platform that you don't know exactly how people will use your platform and when. If someone is going to do something new with your platform, they may not tell you in advance.  This is especially true if you have designed for self-service.

### Understand “anti-users”

There will also be actors who wish to misuse the platform or the data it holds. It is important to understand their potential motivations and design against them.

>### Identifying users of Government as a Platform in the UK
>Many of us joined GDS to work directly on things which matters to users. We realised that, organisationally, our job had shifted to meeting the needs of other civil servants, so that they can meet the needs of their users and, as a consequence of that, public services improve and the quality of people's experience of the state is transformed.
>
>Citizens are not the only valid users – even GOV.UK itself has a huge number of civil servant users who are using it as a publishing tool.
>
>We needed to start thinking about our users as being service teams around government. Shifting from thinking about making services for citizens to making products for service teams was a tough shift for GDS.
>
>To identify the needs of our users, we did 150 interviews with service teams across government. We identified those teams from service assessments, the GOV.UK performance platform and also the 4,000+ PDF forms that are hosted on GOV.UK. We asked them things like: Tell us about your users? Tell us about the needs you are meeting? Tell us about the needs you can't meet but would love to meet?

## Actions

* Identify potential organizations who might use your platform (note: they may not be in government)
* Identify the types of users in those organizations, including non-technical roles
* Conduct user research with users in those organizations
* Identify any areas that citizens might interact with the platform and a range of user journeys where they might encounter it
* Do joint user research with the teams who are using the platform to understand the user-facing parts.
* Understand the things your team might need to operate the platform
* Maintain a list of “anti-users”
* Work in the open - maintain good communications with your users so you understand how they are using the platform and they understand any upcoming changes
* Work to understand the roadmaps of any large services making use of your platform
* Use analytics to understand new and emerging use-cases for the platform
